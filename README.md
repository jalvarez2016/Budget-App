# BudgetApp #
## Heading ##
Tired of spending all the money you worked two weeks to make in two days? Want to become more *financially literate* and improve *fiscal responsibility?* Well, *BudgetApp* is in your corner!. Create budgets and add items to them to become your own money manager with just a few clicks or taps!
## Sub-Heading ##
BudgetApp is for those who seek to have more control over themselves and ultimately their spending habits by having them look over their own shoulders.
## Summary ##
BudgetApp allows a user to create budgets with a set amount they plan to spend in this budget, and also add items that they have bought (or will buy) in the name of this budget. The app will calculate the subtotal of the items' cost and also calculate whether or not that total fits with the amount that was set. Users can also rate the items that they add to each budget as well as add a date of purchase. This allows the app to generate a compressive spending report that could sum up purchases within a time frame and also show what kind of items the user spends the most on. With these features BudgetApp can function as both a planning and reporting service for the user to take control of their spending.
## Problem ##
BudgetApp solves the problem of users not being able to keep track of their spending habits effectively enough to curb them. Banking apps allows one to track what they've spent on, but only if they use their debit/credit card and all the purchases aren't characterized at all. Wanton untracked spending is usually what causes people to spend recklessly.
## Solution ##
BudgetApp provides an organizational structure to its users to be able to manage, plan and track their spending habits. Having the user be their own boss will allow them to pace themselves and also help them teach themselves how to be responsible. An fun and engaging UX/UI will also help to encourage them to come back time and again to keep them budgeting!
## Key Technical Challenge ##
Trying to implement image storage for items and user profile pictures. Otherwise, from the roadmap that currently exists, no significant hurdles are currently foreseen.
## Extension Opportunities ##
- Adding more data analytics to provide the user with more windows through which they can analyze their spending, use as adding categories to items (like: transportation, food, etc.)
- Email summaries of spending on a configurable basis.
- Alerts when a user is overbudget.
- A birthday notification.
- Banking integration.
